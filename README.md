# Audio processing - by MarcosJSP

The objective of this project is to familiarize myself with audio processing. Unfortunately there is no audio visual demo, just a gif:

## Development

The project is a sound visualizer. Basically for every instant of the song, the visualizer shows the amplitude of each frequency.

If you want to use the project with a different song, just add the sound file onto the project directory, having in mind that if you change the song name to something different from song.wav you also need to change the song name for the `audioPlayer`.
